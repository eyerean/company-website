=======

Made in [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) mostly for practice purposes.
Using [Reflux](https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs) for the Flux architecture.

This project started as a fork: [ReactStarter](https://github.com/eyerean/ReactStarter/tree/company-website). New commits will be in this repo from now on.

To run the project type
`npm install` for the first time, and then just `gulp`.

Don't forget to change `var baseUrl` with your api endpoint in `src/utils/api.jsx` and job variables in `src/components/job-details.jsx` in order to run without errors.
